Today I worked for 10 hours and it was boring and exhausting but I got money so it's ok I guess. I need to better so I can live a much more fufilling life.

I got out of work tomorrow so maybe I'll take advantage of this time to learn something new. In all likelihood though I'll just waste time on the internet again. Or sleeping.

Damn I'm too predictable, and it really bums me out.
